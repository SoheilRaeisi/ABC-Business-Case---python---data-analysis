Objective: 
The primary goal of this case study is to evaluate the potential impact of a new calling strategy for Sales Account Managers (AMs) at ABC. 
The proposed strategy involves reallocating a higher percentage of AMs' time to a specific target group of merchants. 
The project aims to identify which AMs should participate in a pilot test and determine the metrics that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the new strategy.
